# not_a_database
This is a program that operates kind of like a database. You can log in with a valid username and password. The program checks to see if the login credentials are in the "database" file and allows the user to log in or not. The user can then see the information the file has on them. They have the option of logging off or creating a new user. The program will ask for information for the new user and then store that new user in the file.

Made to run on python3.
